# leaf-reader
Offline comic book reader with WASD/Arrow key support.
 
Developed for fans of offline comic/manga collecting & reading.
Leaf Reader is a handy tool that displays your comics in a gallery and allows you to enjoy comic reading without the downsides of online reading (ads, bad connection etc.) while avoiding the navigational problems of simply locating a folder with no cover and then reading with Image Viewer.

## Just place your image folders inside the /library directory and then locate that directory and Leaf Reader will take care of the rest.
